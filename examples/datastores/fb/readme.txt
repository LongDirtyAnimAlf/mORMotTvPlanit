This demo shows how a Firebird database can be used for VisualPlanIt. It 
takes advantage of the prebuilt TVpFirefordDatastore.

NOTE:
The project creates a new database on the fly. For reasons unknown at the moment,
an exception is raised here if started from the IDE. This does not happen any
more once the database exists.
